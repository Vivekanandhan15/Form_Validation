# Form Validation Project

This is a simple web form validation project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project demonstrates how to validate user inputs on the client side 
to improve data quality and enhance user experience.

## Features

- Real-time validation for input fields
- Error messages for invalid inputs
- Clean and responsive form design
- JavaScript logic for form submission control

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript 

## How It Works

1. User enters information into the form fields (name, email, etc.).
2. JavaScript checks for:
   - Empty fields
   - Valid email format
3. If validation fails, helpful error messages are displayed.
4. If all fields are valid, the form submits successfully (or triggers your custom action).
